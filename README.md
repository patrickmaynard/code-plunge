# Code plunge

This is a game for practicing the use of the most common PHP functions. (More languages coming soon.)

It is based on Tetris. To play the game, visit http://patrickmaynard.github.io/code-plunge 

Apologies for the terrible JavaScript and HTML. I am not a frontend developer these days, so I'm hoping to eventually get some help refactoring.

## TODO items:

* Add a score area at the bottom
* Create logic for generating the numbers/strings you'll use as operands in the drills
* Create a listener on the input field that listens for the "return" or "enter" key and runs a count() via http://asmblah.github.io/uniter/
* Add a few more functions from https://www.exakat.io/en/top-100-php-functions/
* Add a pause click listener that slaps a modal up on the screen
* Get help from someone on refactoring the frontend code
* Get help from some devs in other languages on adding support for additional languages
* Create a "(re)start game" button at the bottom
* Move this to your personal server so you can hook it up to a database for logins, recording of high scores, etc.,.
* Now that the code is no longer being served directly from GitHub, exclude the NPM package folder from version control
* Fix bug that causes occasional overlap of blocks
