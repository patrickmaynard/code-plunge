# Code plunge

This is a game for practicing the use of the most common PHP functions. (More languages coming soon.)

It is based on Tetris. To play the game, visit http://patrickmaynard.github.io/code-plunge 

Apologies for the terrible JavaScript and HTML. I am not a frontend developer these days, so I'm hoping to eventually get some help refactoring.

## TODO items:

* Create a basic HTML area in which to play the game
* Create an input field that takes in code the player types
* Create a "(re)start game" button at the bottom
* Create a vanilla js file called game.js that will (for now) hold all the logic for the game
* Create logic for falling strings that the code needs to manipulate
* Create logic for losing the game
* Create a listener on the input field that listens for the "return" or "enter" key and runs a count() via http://asmblah.github.io/uniter/
* Add a few more functions from https://www.exakat.io/en/top-100-php-functions/
* Get help from someone on refactoring the frontend code
* Add an intro screen that allows the user to select a langauge (just PHP for now)
* Get help from some devs in other languages on adding support for additional languages
* Move this to your personal server so you can hook it up to a database for logins, recording of high scores, etc.,.
